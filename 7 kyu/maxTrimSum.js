/*Task
Given an array/list of integers, find the maximum sum of 3 DISTINCT array elements.

Notes :
array size is at least 3 .
array elements can be zero or negative
Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when summing).
Input >> Output Examples
maxTriSum ({3,2,6,8,2,3}) ==> return (17)
Best triplet = {6,8,3}, its sum is 17
maxTriSum ({2,1,8,0,6,4,8,6,2,4}) ==> return (18)
Best triplet = {8, 6, 4} , its sum is 18.
maxTriSum ({-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29}) ==> return (41)
Best triplet = {12 , 29 , 0} , its sum is 41
